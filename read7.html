							    <b>CLOUD COMPUTING</p>
								<p>
                                Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage 
								(cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally
								used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.Large clouds, predominant today,
								often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user
								is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.

                                Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).

								Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.

								Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT
								infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up 
								and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly 
								adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing capability:
								high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.

									Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses
									if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.

									The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread 
									adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has 
									led to growth in cloud computing.[10][11][12] As of 2017, most cloud computers run a Linux-based operating system.
