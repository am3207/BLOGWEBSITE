							    <b>BLOCKCHAIN</p>
								<p>
                                A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography.
								[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
								(generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block
								was published in order to get into its hash. Blocks contain the hash of the previous block, forming a chain, with
								each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification
								of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without 
								altering all subsequent blocks.

								Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where 
								nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records
								are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a 
								distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.

								The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using
								the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
								[3] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made 
								
								it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
								The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used
								by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.[6] Private blockchains have been proposed for
								business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".
								[7] However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and 
								therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.
