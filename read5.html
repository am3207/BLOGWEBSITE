                                Engadget operates a number of blogs spanning seven different languages including English, Chinese 
								(traditional and simplified), Japanese, Spanish, Polish (until April 1, 2010), Korean and German.
								The English edition of Engadget operates four blogs which, like the international editions, have
								been assimilated into a single site with a sub-domain prefix. These include Engadget Classic 
								
								
								(the original Engadget blog), Engadget Mobile, Engadget HD and Engadget Alt. As of late 2013, 
								these editions exist but have been wrapped into Engadget Classic. In March 2014, a UK edition 
								of Engadget also launched to target the developing European tech market.

                                Launched in March 2004, Engadget is updated multiple times a day with articles on gadgets and consumer 
								electronics. It also posts rumors about the technological world, frequently offers opinion within its stories,
								and produces the weekly Engadget Podcast that covers tech and gadget news stories that happened during the week.

                                Since its founding, dozens of writers have written for or contributed to Engadget, Engadget Alt,
								Engadget Mobile and Engadget HD, including high-profile bloggers, industry analysts, and professional
								journalists. These writers include Jason Calacanis, Paul Boutin, Phillip Torrone, Joshua Fruhlinger and
								Susan Mernit. Darren Murph,[16] has worked on the site as Managing Editor and Editor-at-Large. He has written
								over 17,212 posts as of October 5, 2010. Industry analyst Ross Rubin contributed a weekly column called
								Switched On from October 2004 to March 2014.
