							    <b>Artificial INTELLIGENCE</p>
								<p>
                                Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
								displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between 
								the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as
								artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called 
								artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of
								"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its 
								chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often
								used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind,
								such as "learning" and "problem solving"

								As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from
								the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says 
								"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from
								things considered to be AI,having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as
								AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems 
								(such as chess and Go), and also imperfect-information games like poker, self-driving cars, intelligent routing 
								in content delivery networks, and military simulations.
