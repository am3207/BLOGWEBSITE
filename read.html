								<p>


								Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
								Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use 
								of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to 
								help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

								Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
								including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
								Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

								Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
								and first released it in 1991 as Python . Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, 
								such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. 
								Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible
								and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

								Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>
