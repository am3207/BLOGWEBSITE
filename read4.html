							    <b>MACHINE LEARNING</p>
								<p>
                                Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
								and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms 
								build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions 
								without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety
								of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible
								to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

								A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions
								using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical 
								optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
								Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
								In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
